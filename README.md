Description of Assignments
==========================

BinaryDecimalConverter
----------------------
A simple program for converting numbers from binary to base-10 and vice-versa using a GUI. This was independent work and not a part of any required assignments.

lab0
----
A simple program that prints my initials in large text.

lab1
----
Outputs two classic poems, demonstrating how two methods can help avoid redundancy.

lab2
----
This program prompts the user to input the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies he or she has, adds them together, and prints the results to the console. It then prompts the user for a value in cents, splits that into quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, and outputs that to the console.

lab3
----
This program performs two tasks. First, it prompts the user for the present value and interest rate of an account gaining compound interest, as well as the number of years that the interest will accrue. It then outputs the final value of the account to the console. Second, it prompts the user for the monthly payment, interest rate, and number of years on an annuity. It then outputs the final value of the annuity to the console.

lab4
----
Contains two programs, Hyperbola and StarWarsName. Hyperbola draws two parabolas with grid lengths defined by LOWER_GRID_LENGTH and UPPER_GRID_LENGTH inside a DrawingPanel with dimensions defined by PANEL_SIZE. StarWarsName prompts the user for their first and last name as well as his or her mother's maiden name, the city in which he or she was born, and the make of the first car he or she drove. It then generates and outputs their Star Wars first and last name as well as his or her Star Wars planet.

lab5
----
This program prompts the user to enter the center coordinate and radius of three different circles. It then draws the circles and tells the user how their sizes compare and whether or not they intersect.

lab6
----
This program asks the user to enter in a probability, and then uses that probability to calculate the results of a simulated championship. The program simulates playoffs until one team has beat the other by 10 playoffs. A team wins a playoff if they win 4 games before the other team, and a team wins a game if their random score beats their chance of winning.

lab7
----
This program demonstrates a "random walk" in which a pixel moves in random directions until it exits a specified circle.

lab8
----
This program first prompts the user to enter a decimal number then converts that to binary. It then asks the user to enter a binary number and converts that to decimal. It then asks the user if they wish to continue, and does so if they say yes, and exits if they say no.

lab9
----
This program demonstrates the Sieve of Eratosthenes, an algorithm for finding prime numbers. It first asks the user for a number n, and the algorithm will find all prime numbers from 1 to n. An animation is presented to show the algorithm at work.

project1
--------
This program first prompts the user to enter the range for a table that converts kilograms to pounds, then prints that table. It then prints a table that converts feet and inches to meters, ranging from 0 feet to 9 feet, 11 inches.

project2
--------
This program prompts the user for a color and a diameter (pixels) and displays an animated bouncing ball matching those (and other) parameters.
